# Documentation demo

If you see this `README.md` file in GitHub website, please click directly on [GitHub pages](https://do-team.github.io/document/#/) of this project, so you can see it in action, rendered in all it's beauty. However, via GitHub website, you can check real source code of these files simply by browsing the repository. For example, `index.html` is stored  [here](https://github.com/do-team/document/blob/master/index.html).

?> *Also, it is print friendly.*

## Why

[This repository](https://github.com/do-team/document/) serves as an example of fictitious documentation, stored in form of the source code (mainly MarkDown syntax) in GitHub.  
This way you can utilise [GitHub Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) process to control changes over various types of documentation. Workflow itself is capable to replace existing approval tools (ie. Alfresco, EEPR etc.), but to figure out, how to "translate" your current work into form of the source code is the main challenge here.  

## What

This whole documentation page is described with [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax, using some external libraries.  
Main renderer is [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org), but as you will see in other chapters (see sidebar menu), we inject certain libraries to enable charts, graphs and mathematical equations.  
There are many alternatives to Docsify, using native Jekyll or whatever.  
Final result is rendered as static webpage, using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting the result.  

## Where

What you read now is content of default `README.md` file in root of repository. As this suppose to be publicly available demo, you can have a look directly at [source code repository](https://github.com/do-team/document), to better understand, how this was actually made.
