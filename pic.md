### How to insert pictures?

Quite easily. Just type in `![name of the picture](URL of the picture)`.  
For example, `![GitHub logo](githublogo.png)` will look like this:  
![GitHub logo](githublogo.png)  
Picture must be in the repository of course.  
Do not forget, that aligning and formatting of images are driven by CSS, not by MarkDown!
